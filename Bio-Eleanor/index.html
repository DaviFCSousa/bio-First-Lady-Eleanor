            Former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was a tireless advocate for women and social justice, and left an indelible mark on society. Eleanor was born on October 11, 1884 in Manhattan, New York, into a family that was part of the New York establishment. She lost both her parents by the age of 10 and was raised by relatives until the age of 15. She attended Allenswood Boarding Academy, a finishing school in Wimbledon, England, from 1899 to 1902. The headmistress, Marie Souvestre, was an educator who sought to cultivate independence and social responsibility in young women. She took a special interest in Roosevelt, who flourished under her leadership.1 At 18, Eleanor was summoned home to New York City by her grandmother to make her social debut. After her return she became actively involved in social service work, joined the Junior League and taught impoverished immigrant children at the Rivington Street Settlement House.2

            Roosevelt’s political activism did not end with her husband’s death in 1945. Appointed in 1946, she served for more than a decade as a delegate to the United Nations, the institution established by her husband, and embraced the cause of world peace. She not only chaired the United Nations Human Rights Commission, she also helped write the 1948 United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. She spoke out against McCarthyism in the 1950s. Roosevelt’s continued commitment to racial justice was evident in her civil rights work and efforts to push Washington to take swifter action in housing desegregation and protections for Freedom Riders and other activists. In 1960, at the request of President John F. Kennedy, she chaired the President’s Commission on the Status of Women, which released a ground-breaking study about gender discrimination a year after her death in 1963. She also worked on the Equal Pay Act that was passed that same year. Kennedy nominated Roosevelt for the Nobel Peace Prize and though she did not win, she remained at the top of national polls ranking the most respected women in America decades after her death.
