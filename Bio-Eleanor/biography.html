                    Anna Eleanor Roosevelt was born on October 11, 1884, in New York City. She was the oldest child of Elliot Roosevelt and Anna Hall. She lost both parents by the age of ten.
                    Following the death of her mother, she was raised by her maternal grandmother, Mary Hall, and later attended a private London finishing school called Allenswood Academy. In 1902, Eleanor returned to the United States for her debut into New York society. She also began her long career in social work, joining the Junior League and teaching immigrant children at the Riving Street Settlement House.

                    When Franklin Delano Roosevelt became president in 1933, Eleanor downplayed the role of first lady, saying “there is going to be just plain, ordinary Mrs. Roosevelt and that’s all.”
                    Despite this statement, she went on to transform the role of first lady. She became the first first lady to have her own press conferences for women reporters, holding more than three hundred throughout her twelve years in the White House.
                    As her husband’s New Deal policies went into effect, providing relief and helping the nation combat the Great Depression, Eleanor traveled the country, visiting the sites of relief projects, delivering radio broadcasts, and meeting citizens. She recounted her adventures and expressed her opinions in a syndicated newspaper column, “My Day,” which ran from 1935 until her death in 1962.

                    Between 1941 and 1942, Eleanor served as Assistant Director of Civilian Defense, organizing volunteer workers.
                    After the United States entered World War II, she traveled to England where she spent time with wounded servicemembers and visited military bases and distribution centers. In 1943, Eleanor became the first first lady to travel to an active war zone when she undertook a month-long journey to the warfront in the Pacific. Traveling as a representative of the Red Cross, she went to Australia, New Zealand, Guadalcanal, and numerous Pacific islands, visiting troops, hospitals, and factories.
